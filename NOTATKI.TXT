Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable
(identifier) can be looked up. This look-up may be for the purposes of
assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (lefthand-side) reference,
or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS
(righthand-side) reference

LHS references result from assignment operations. Scope-related as‐
signments can occur either with the = operator or by passing argu‐
ments to (assign to) function parameters.

we defined “scope” as the set of rules that govern how
the engine can look up a variable by its identifier name and find it,
either in the current scope, or in any of the nested scopes it’s contained
within
